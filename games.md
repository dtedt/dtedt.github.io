### Interactive Fiction 
These are complete, playable text-based narrative games I have written and created myself.

- [You Cannot Speak (2025)](/ycs/index.html)<sup>Inkle</sup>
  My [IFComp 2025](https://ifcomp.org) entry. Based on a Science-Fiction premise developed for Outpost4.

- [Bartley's World (2024)](/Bartley/index.html)<sup>Inkle<sup>
  A melodrama about a marriage in crisis. One of the characters is a frog.


### Inkle Prototypes
These are prototypes of text-based narrative games created using [Inkle, the narrative scripting language](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

- [Persistence (2024)](/se/index.html)<sup>v.0.5</sup>
  A stealth game prototype. Developed for Outpost4.
- [Pluck! (2024)](/Pluck/index.html)<sup>v0.5</sup>
  A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure superhero story with character customization and gender inclusivity.


### Bitsy Prototypes
My first game demos were created in the [Bitsy Engine](https://bitsy.org/). I recommend it highly for prototyping simple concepts. These only took me a few hours each to build, and sometimes the need to express your idea immediately in a tangible form is more important than using a sophisticated game engine. These are some of the first internal prototypes I created for Outpost4.

- [Marina (2023)](/mars.html) <sup>v.2</sup>
  A prototype for an adventure game set on Mars. This premise is further developed in [You Cannot Speak](/ycs/index.html).
- [The Silent Engines (2023)](/silent.html) <sup>v.1</sup>
  A prototype for a stealth game. This premise formed the basis for [Persistence](/se/index.html).
