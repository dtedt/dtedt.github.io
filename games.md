### Inkle Prototypes
These are prototypes of text-based narrative games created using [Inky](), the desktop application for [Inkle, the narrative scripting language](). I am a big believer in Interactive Fiction as a means of expressing what the word written on paper cannot. It's also just fun.

### Bitsy Prototypes
My first game demos were created in the [Bitsy Engine](https://bitsy.org/). I recommend it highly for prototyping simple concepts. These only took me a few hours each to build, and sometimes the need to express your idea immediately in a tangible form is more important than using a sophisticated game engine. These are some of the first internal prototypes I created for Outpost4.
