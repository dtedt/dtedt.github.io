I would like to share what I have been working on recently. I am very proud of it.

I have created a new structure for approaching and tracking progress on daily tasks and long-term goals alike. I chose to start with three primary goals: writing blog content, developing game ideas and finding a job. In addition, I added some simple accountability features for e-learning and chores.

My new structure is entirely contained in my Obsidian app. Obsidian is a plain text notes app with numerous built-in features and plug-ins. Obsidian is such a powerful and flexible tool for recording ideas that many refer to their Obsidian vault as their "Second Brain". The main feature I rely upon is **Daily Notes**, which generates a new note each day based on a template I created.

Here is my file directory, where I store all of my notes neatly:

Here is what my daily note looks like tonight, after a fairly productive day of chores and personal projects:

Each heading is a dropdown which reveals a sub-list. Let’s briefly tour my Daily Note starting with my Morning Intentions:

This is more or less the first thing I wrote down after I woke up today. Faced with the question of what I should focus on today, I decided I wanted more practice with the Godot engine. That set me with an aim to begin my day with. Of course, distractions are inevitable and during my morning routine I encountered a series of unordered thoughts, which I recorded in the next section:

*Begging micro-celebrities for money isn’t really my style, but when the rent is due, you become more open-minded (and slightly undignified).*

I partly created this system to avoid wasting too much time ruminating and reflecting, which is how I naturally process my thoughts. With the system, I externalize my thoughts. This enables me to remain active in my pursuits while preserving those thoughts I have throughout the day.

Next is my blog drafts:

This table is a dynamic list created using Obsidian’s **Bases** core plug-in. It displays only blog drafts I have created (or modified) today. I’m working on a summary of a good zoom lecture I watched this afternoon, by [The Narrative Department](thenarrativedepartment.com).

Next: my Reading

I didn’t get around to cracking open a book, but I did read an essay on a topic I’ve been thinking about and some documentation on the new software I’m using.

Next: Game Ideas

*This section utilizes [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) to embed dynamic tables.*

Right now my primary goal (aside from getting a job) is to prototype a game on my own. I have several unfinished game prototypes floating around [my GitHub](https://github.com/dtedt), but what I need now is to accumulate _finished_ projects. Finishing what I start has always been a difficulty for me. Nonetheless, I must finish this blog post.

Learning:

Just a simple checklist, but this is really helpful for me. I don’t have to do all of these things everyday, but I should do a few.

Job Search:

Just some notes on my job search. These might be useful to review at some point in the future, but I mostly just write these down to get me thinking.

Evening Review:

Finally, time to reflect! Here I can observe the discrepency between my morning intentions and what I ended up doing. It’s only natural to deviate from the plan somewhat, but if I begin to stray too far from my goals I can keep myself accountable here.

The last section is a table of notes I either created or modified on this day:

This is nice because I can see my work and progress in a quantifiable way. I might feel like I didn’t do enough, but then I can look at this and say “Well, I did write 16 notes, that’s something.”

This is a new structure that I’ve only been using for three days, but I’m hoping it will help me achieve my goals. Also, I have a confession to make: I used ChatGPT to ideate and come up with this structure. I’m not a big fan of using AI frivolously, but I do find it useful for constructing a scaffolding to my thoughts and ideas. My ADHD makes me hopelessly disorganized by nature, so I must use any tool I can to bring order to my thoughts.

I hope this has been helpful to you! I think that a lot of creative people struggle with personal organization, and it’s a terrible waste of potential when our minds are disordered and dysfunctional. So if you are reading this from your bed, lying on your side, dehydrated, feeling incapable of even standing up or going for a walk, don’t despair! I was you last year. Through the application of critical thought, perserverance and a little pharmacological assistance, you can achieve anything!
