<h1>Creating A High-Performing Medtech App with <strong>BDC</strong></h1>
<br>
    <h2>The Client</h2>
    <p>BDC was contracted to develop a new prototype, a redesign of an existing application that was simply not connecting with users as desired. Andrew pitched the idea of a gamified redesign, and now he was looking for a real game studio to bring an expert touch to this new prototype.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>The already existing application functioned, however it had low favorability with users and users frequently failed to engage with the app with the intended regularity (weekly check-ins). BDC already had a vision for an improved version of the application, but they needed seasoned game designers to implement the concept with special attention to interface design and interactivity.
</p>
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>We implemented BDC's concept using the Unity engine in order to make it more dynamic and reactive. This enabled us to implement haptic feedback and [<em>other features</em>]
 </p>
<h2>The Results</h2>
<p>Once we placed the finishing touches on the prototype, it was sent out to participants in a trial run and the results of testing spoke for themself: 20x increase in re-engagement of dormant users, 3.4x increase in retention, 2.1x increase in tasks completed within the app.
    </p>
    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <p>
        Our collaboration with BDC was not merely a successful effort to produce an application. We effectively discovered and tested a new approach to medical communication technology that could potentially change the way doctors relate with patients about their condition.

    <h1>Notes</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Mention our use of tools such as lambdatest and amplitude</li>
                <li>Differentiate between BDC's specialty (design informed by behavioral science) vs our specialty (design informed by gameplay immersion and usability)</li>
          <li>unpack the research & development phases</li>
        <li>be sure to indicate that we used visual assets from an internal design department</li>
