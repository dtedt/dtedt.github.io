# Dennis Of Delphi (working title)

# Characters

*Themistoclea*

The Pythia, high priestess and acting Oracle of Delphi whose prophesy and advice is much sought after. Bathes in the sacred Castalian Spring and chews laurel leaves to remain pure. Inhales fumes from the Earth in order to enter a trance state and deliver prophesy during the Prophesy Ritual.

*Plutarch*

Head priest of the Oracular Temple and a noted philosopher. Direct report of Temple custodians.

*Dennis*

Janitor of the Oracular Temple responsible for cleaning the latrines and preparing goats for sacrifice. Occasionally runs errands for Plutarch.

*Eunice*

A goat.

# Scenarios

**Scenario A**
The Pythia must be prepared for the arrival of King Croesus, who is arriving on short notice. While she bathes in the Castallan River, Plutarch sends you to gather laurel leaves.

*Laurel leaves grow under the sign of The Spider. Find the constellation and pick leaves at the tree beneath it.*

**Scenario B**
A goat escapes just as the prophesy ritual is about to begin. Plutarch commands you to track it down. The Pythia, already in her trance state, prophesies that the goat will be found between the sign of The Horse and the sign of The Whale. 

*Eunice is hiding in the forest. Instead of checking every bush in the area, find the sign of The Horse and The Whale. Search the bushes in-between.*

**Scenario C**

Now that the prophesy has been granted and King Croesus is departing, Plutarch reprimands you. He insists that a goat has never escaped the prophesy ritual, and blames you. He insists that to rid yourself of bad luck, Apollo must be supplicated. Go perform a libation ritual under the proper star signs: 1 beast, 1 man, 1 woman and 1 bird.

*In order to perform the ritual, You will need to fill the sacred Phiale with honey and oil from the farm. Then, go forth and find an area of the sky with the appropriate combination of constellations. Perform the libation ritual.
