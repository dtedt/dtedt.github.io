Each of the colonists necessarily had to pass a **Psych Evaluation** in order to be selected for the [Ares-622](Ares622) mission. This Psych Evaluation favored applicants with specific personality traits while rejecting applicants with traits undesirable for space travel and isolation. The presumption of the evaluation is that mental illness in space can be costly and dangerous, and the people involved in the sensitive operations of spacefaring ought to be impervious to lapses in judgment. This evaluation is also intended to limit [CHI](CHI.md)'s liability in the event of an accident.

The following personality traits were favored by the Psych Evaluation:

- Self-sufficiency
- Confidence
- Initiative, etc.

The following personality traits were rejected by the Psych Evaluation:

- Introspection
- Depression
- Anxiety, etc.

This _officially_ means that all Ares colonists possess traits from the first list and none from the second list. In practice, probably no such person exists who bears the strengths of list A without the vulnerabilities of List B. 

### Neurodivergence In Space
It is an implicit assumption among spacefaring laborers that neurodivergent traits, particularly conditions such as ADHD, Bipolar, Autism,  Borderline and Depression, are considered a liability by employers. Therefore it is standard practice for spacefarers to lie on psych evaluations.

Ironically, the ideal candidate for spacefaring is more often than not the neurodivergent spacefarer; those who excel in technical fields and do not mind the solitude often necesitated by the job.  In this way, the neurodivergent spacefarer is acclaimed for their successes until such a time as their condition produces a failure (mental breakdown, burnout, emotional distress), at which point the neurodivergent spacefarer is punished severely, and the corporate body suffers zero liability. 

This could be likened to the US Military's late 20th century "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy, except in this case spacefarers are implicitly expected to be asked and lie.

Marina is most certainly one such example of a neurodivergent person masking her condition in order to sustain her career. Many other colonists are likely in the same boat.
