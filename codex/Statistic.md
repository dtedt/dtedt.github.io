Each of the colonists necessarily had to pass a Psych Evaluation in order to be selected for the mission. This Psych Evaluation favored applicants with specific personality traits while rejecting applicants with traits undesirable for space travel and isolation.

The following personality traits were favored by the Psych Evaluation:

- Self-sufficiency
- Confidence
- Initiative

The following personality traits were rejected by the Psych Evaluation:

- Introspection
- Depression
- Insecurity

This officially means that all Ares colonists possess traits from the first list and no one (officially) on the base possesses traits from the second list, though this seems a questionable conclusion.

Marina, who was included on the roster unofficially by Executive Avery, was not subjected to a Psych Eval and likely possesses traits from the second list. She has also been diagnosed with Selective Mutism, a psychological affliction which would have likely disqualified her from official recruitment
