**The Elevator**

Early on in Marina's adventure it becomes apparent that Marina is fated to ascend to [Level04](Level04) where she will embark on a short but dangerous surface exhibition to [Outpost004](Outpost004). There she can reboot the electrical grid at [the Solar Power Station](SolarPower.md) and, if she so chooses, [escape to Earth or return to Ares-622](Endings.md).

The most obvious route to take is to simply ride the Elevator to Level04, however due to the initial [power outage](Chaos.md) the Elevator is not operational at the outset of her adventure. Marina will have to either proceed [up the stairs](Stairs.md), or collect special items to restore temporary power to the Elevator.

## Compatible Items

- When the Elevator is operational early in Day One, before the need to escape is apparent, enterprising players who acquire the [Freewily](TORUS.md) app can hack the Elevator permissions and visit the Radio Room on Level04, where the [Letter In A Bottle](Quests.md) questline begins.

- After the power outage, the Elevator shaft can only be traversed using a hidden item, the *Rappel Harness*. This item can be found on [Level00](Level00.md) in Ruth's locker. Ruth's special maintenence permissions are required to obtain access to the locker. This iteam allows players to skip much of the game, as one can immediately rappel to Level04 and depart Ares-622.

## Scripted Elevator Repair

- [Gene](Gene.md) spends Day 3 restoring power to the Elevator by diverting power away from the [Level03 Wellness Center](), jeopardizing colonists on life support under [Maxine's](Maxine.md) care and enabling easy access to Level04.
