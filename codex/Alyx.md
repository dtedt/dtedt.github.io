#Character 

**Alex is an Information Analyst on Level04, and while the rest of her team is goofing off and playing ping pong, she is determined to get to the bottom of the outbreak by conducting a statistical analysis of the colonists in order to discover trends that indicate why some colonists have become Others and some have not. To complete her quest, you must provide her with every database on Ares-622. This includes 6 databases: Security’s criminal database, Wellness’s health, fitness and psych databases, Biology’s research database and Geology’s material breach database. Alex’s analysis is strictly against the rules, but each database can be acquired if Marina is stealthy enough.**
