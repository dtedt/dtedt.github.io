What follows is an evaluation of each character on the level of unconscious desire. This is meant as a writing exercise and these motivations should not be directly alluded to in-game.

### Marina
Marina’s aversion to speech reflects a fear of culpability. Despite being confident in her skills, she defers to others as a way of not being held accountable. She blames herself for her sister’s death and is caught in the denial phase of grief, prolonging her suffering to avoid an inevitable confrontation with herself.
### Gene
Gene’s arrogance conceals a fear of abandonment. His obsession with obtaining wealth is an attempt to create a stable environment, unlike the one he grew up in. His parents died after working hard to send him to an elite school, and he’s estranged from his brother due to an old family grudge. He has little expectation of relying on anyone but himself. His cynicism is a means of coping with a world he sees as cruel and unchanging. His real desire is to protect the ones he loves (at the expense of anyone else). 
### Maxine
Maxine’s ceaseless efforts toward helping others enables her to avoid reflecting upon her own troubled past. Little is known about her background, but beneath her industrious urgency she harbors a deep shame. Her ability to maintain authority over her environment exempts her from being subject to criticism. By remaining in a perpetual state of crisis management, problems external to her continually take precedence over her long neglected personal issues.
### Alyx
Alyx is committed to her job because her work signifies her value and grants her a sense of worth she has been deprived of in her personal life. A victim of discrimination and persecution for her transsexual identity, she clings to her work as a legitimated guarantee of her right to exist in society.
### Rhea
Rhea’s career and heritage are in contradiction. She’s proud of herself for moving up in the world, but she feels as if she’s betrayed her roots in becoming a “white-passing” corporate executive. 
### Melodie
Melodie was known to be an outwardly happy person, a free spirit, and a disappointment to her parents. Melodie’s early childhood was dismal, and she couldn’t help but notice everything got better when Marina was born. While Marina was praised for her intelligence and responsible judgment, Melodie’s intellect was condescended to and she was praised only for her looks. She entered into a chain of abusive sexual relationships and never had a career. On several occasions throughout her adult life she “bottomed out,” re-emerging at Marina’s home to borrow money. She loved Marina very much, but felt too ashamed of herself to express it directly. Their relationship soured as a result, prompting Marina to depart for the moon to train as a space porter. Melodie soon died of an opiate overdose, which Marina was informed of moments before departing the moon for Mars.
### Mr. Wilhelm
To examine Mr Wilhelm's unconscious desire is impossible, perhaps because his human intelligence has been simultaneously enhanced and destroyed. Unable to sustain symbolic or imaginary fictions, Mr Wilhelm's mind is as inscrutable as his speech. Perhaps this is due to madness, perhaps it is due to mental disability or perhaps it is possession of the transcendental intelligence imputed to prophets.
