**START V** is a monumental international treaty which banned several technologies from commercial use, including [artificial intelligence](AI.md) and space travel. Despite being a controversial and widely despised compromise, it is widely agreed to have deterred a third World War.

## EARTH IN 2045

The terms “Capitalism” and “Communism” are increasingly relics of obscure history. America and China are still the predominant “superpowers,” but world affairs are tightly governed by (and some would say staged by) an international coalition of corporate and state interests known as Hé (pronounced and stylized as Huah in English). Hé was founded with the establishment of the START V treaty on September 13th, 2039, which is widely considered to have prevented a third World War after the collapse of Russia.

## START V and Ares-622

The development, creation and launch of the Mars colony Ares-622 is precipitated by the START V treaty on Earth, a piece of international legislature which heavily regulates, limits or in some cases outright bans the following scientific enterprises:

Artificial Intelligence
Robotics
Cryptography (for both cybersecurity and cryptocurrency)
Cloning and genetic engineering (especially “gene editing”)
Biohacking (human-machine prosthesis is heavily regulated and taxed)
Geoengineering (weather control and terraforming)
Invasive Neurological Scanning (“mind-reading” or otherwise trafficking thought data)
Space Transit and Trafficking (limited to provisional licensing)
Off-World Mining

These fields of scientific research and development are prohibited to all but a tightly organized confederation of licensed state think tanks known as LOGOS, which rarely publicizes its findings. Private enterprises, such as [Cardoso Heavy Industries](CHI.md), are strictly prohibited from engaging in the aforementioned forms of research. Violating START V is punishable as an act of international terrorism. In the past, corporations in violation of START V have been liquidated, with even low-level employees classified as enemy combatants.
