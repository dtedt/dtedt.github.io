**Cardoso Heavy Industries** is a corporation known mainly for mining and chemical refinement, but which pivoted towards space travel and off-world extraction toward the end of the 21st century.

## SPACE: THE FINAL FRONTIER FOR EXTRACTION
The ban on off-world mining took many in the industry by surprise, and a number of dominant corporations were decimated by fines and reprisals for operations already in progress at the time. This opened up the market for a lesser company like Cardoso Heavy Industries to quadruple in size during the short period following START V, taking the lead in the market. With their eyes set on the stars, CHI lobbied to become the first licensed corporation to break Martian ground since the 2030s, when off-world mining was halted in its infancy. Hé has announced that “open season” will be called on Martian mining claims starting in 2046. Corporations have spent the past ten years preparing their fleets for launch the moment Hé gives the OK on October 5th, 2046

## PROJECT TELOS
In a controversial turn of events, Cardoso Heavy Industries has since attained a provisional Space Transit license allowing them to launch the first ever private space colony on Mars, ahead of the Open Season premiere date. Although the colony has been publicized as a campaign to found a thriving city off-world, it is rumored to be part of CHI’s ultimate goal of monopolizing Mining on the red planet ahead of legalization. 
However, what no one is aware of is the fact that CHI has already been mining and stockpiling mineral deposits on Mars using illegal unmanned robots for the past 10 years. A veritable motherlode of precious minerals has already been extracted, refined and packaged below the planet’s surface and is prepped for transport back to Earth with the completion of CHI’s space elevator project, scheduled to be completed in late 2045. Essentially CHI has already strip-mined the planet ahead of Hé’s starting gun, and while every other Earth corporation is rushing to Mars with licensed mining equipment, CHI will already be transporting their bounty earthbound by the ton.
Ares-622 is primarily an expensive cover for CHI’s true intentions on Mars, but it is also being utilized to conduct illegal research into AI, cloning, cryptography and possibly other fields in contravention of START V. But why would a mining company engage in research unrelated to extraction? It seems as if CHI’s expensive cut-out is being utilized by a mysterious group within its ranks to unknown ends…

## RUMORS

The following rumors circulate on Ares-622 among NPCs and online TORUS message boards, all completely unsubstantiated. The truth behind these rumors can only be determined by completing related sidequests in-game:

- The CS department is conducting Artificial Intelligence experiments in contravention of START V (true)

- There is a secret Neurology laboratory conducting research into fMRI brain-computer interface (mind-reading techniques) in contravention of START V (unconfirmed)

- The Biology department is conducting cloning experiments in contravention of START V (true)

- The Geology Department is conducting weather control experiments in contravention of START V (false)

- Ares-622 is the first private manned base on Mars, but there have been 621 prior “drone bases”. These bases, including Ares-622, are ostensibly for the purpose of commercial research but their true purpose is to scan the planet’s subsurface to mine and store rare mineral deposits (true)

- There is a replicant on the base posing as a colonist (Dr. Su, unconfirmed)

- Ares-622 is not in fact on Mars at all, but on a sound stage in Nevada (false)

- CHI is in the final stages of constructing a Space Elevator which will eliminate the need for rocket transit and create a pipeline for stockpiled mineral resources (true)

- CHI has procured a living cell sample of life on Mars (unconfirmed)

- A colonist on Ares-622 has come into possession of an ancient alien artifact (true/false - The artifact's true origin is unknown and does not prove that life on Mars existed)

- The Galactic Association of Astrologers have unanimously declared that the date and location of Ares-622 spell doom for its inhabitants (true)
