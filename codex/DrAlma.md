#Character 

Dr. Alma Lucretzia is the Chief Science Officer of the Biology Department, located on [LEVEL02](Level02). She is an absent-minded yet upbeat researcher fascinated by the challenges of maintaining life on Mars. 

**Quests 
- Upon learning about the masked Others, she will request that you help her capture a masked person so that she may study them more closely in her laboratory. To complete this quest, activate the trap she has setup on Level02 when a masked Other enters the capture zone.
- Dr Alma may confide with you that despite the emerging catastrophe occurring, she can't take her mind off of a recent soil sample which she claims is showing signs of life. This quest is a reference to [The 1976 Viking Labeled Release (LR) experiment](WhatIsLife.md) and Dr Alma's story touches on the philosophical challenges of defining life outside it's known examples.

## spoilers
Dr. Alma bears a striking resemblance to [Dr. Su](DrSu), her sister. It is also implied that Dr. Alma used to go by "Dr. Lu" until recently she began insisting people call her Dr. Alma.
