**Level01** is where the game begins and is the home of The Wellness Department.

The Wellness Department includes three wings: Mental Wellness (directed by [Dr Su](DrSu.md)), Medical Wellness (directed by [Dr Bhat](DrBhat.md)) and Physical Wellness (directed by [Marina](Marina.md)). It is mainly based on Level01, but there are also wellness centers on each level for first aid and therapy appointments. [The TORUS system](TORUS.md) automatically collects and analyzes data from the colonists’ vital signs and makes automated judgments regarding prescription regimens, fitness plans, dietary restrictions and more.  
Although Wellness may appear at first to be little more than a glorified “Nurse’s Office” to colonists, it is secretly the core research team of [Ares-622](Ares-622.md). The colonists of Ares-622 are unwittingly considered test subjects by [CHI](CHI.md) and the data collected by the Wellness Department is in fact the primary aim of the project, as this test data will inform CHI’s future colonial endeavors on Mars and other planets.
