Ares-622 is the first (?) Mars Colony to be fully operational and boast over 200 colonists in a self-sustaining environment. The colony was founded by Cardosa Heavy Industries (CHI) with the intention of not only conducting research on the planet in several major Scientific fields (Geology, Botany, and Astrophysics), but also facilitating a think tank of scientists developing applied science experiments on the planet (Virology, Robotics, Biology and Aeronautics) in the hopes of building a functional Mining pipeline that will be ready for production by the time their Space Elevator has completed construction.
