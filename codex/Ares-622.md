**Ares-622** is the considered the first [Mars](Mars.md) colony to be fully operational and boast over 200 colonists in a self-sustaining environment. The colony was founded by [Cardosa Heavy Industries (CHI)](CHI.md) with the intention of not only conducting research on the planet in several major Scientific fields (Geology, Botany, and Astrophysics), but also facilitating a think tank of scientists developing applied science experiments on the planet (Virology, Robotics, Biology and Aeronautics) in the hopes of building a functional Mining pipeline that will be ready for production by the time their Space Elevator has completed construction and [START V](StartV.md) has been signed.
