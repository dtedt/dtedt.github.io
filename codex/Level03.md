Level03 is home to the [Geology Department](GeologyDept) led by [Dr. Zak](DrZak)

**

The Geology Department on LEVEL03 is seemingly devoted to the study of the Martian environment and its hazardous minerals, but it is also secretly the seat of CHI’s illegal mining operation. Doctor Zakariah is its Chief Science Officer and his first priority is to study the caustic micro-dust of Mars and engineer ways of protecting the colony from the possibility of direct contact with it. 

On Day 3, a material breach leads to all entrances to LEVEL03 being hermetically sealed, preventing entry. If Marina enters Level03 on Day 2 she will have the opportunity to save the entire base from certain destruction by entering the subterranean lava caverns and collecting a special mineral sample in the Lava Tubes which Doctor Zak can process into an inoculation against Mars Poisoning.

Marina may encounter such a mech on Level03 and commandeer it to complete her mission. There may even be a subterranean route to Outpost4…
