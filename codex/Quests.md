Helping the people of Ares-622 by completing quests will improve Marina's standing in the community and enable a special Ending.

Main Quest:
## Love Me or Leave Me (Gene)

'Love Me Or Leave Me' is the Main Quest line of Marina On Mars, because it is the only quest players are required to complete in order to beat the game. In order to complete this quest, the player must either Leave Mars or elect to Stay. The player's ultimate decision results in one of several possible endings being triggered.

The quest is foreshadowed by a wealth of information available to the player during Act 01 regarding Outpost4, the Rocket Sled method of take-off and the limited window of time during which a flight from Mars to Earth is viable. Marina may encounter this information while reading in the library or through discussions with NPCs in the Engine Room of Ares-622 (found on Level00, accessible with the Security Key). During this time, the seed of an escape plan may already be planted in the player's mind.

Then, Marina advances up the stairs to the Greenhouse on Level02. In the Greenhouse, Gene approaches Marina in a scene reminiscent of the Rival encounters in Pokemon Red. Gene expresses his displeasure with events on Ares-622 and invites you to escape Mars with him. He has heard rumors of a single escape vessel docked at a nearby outpost and informs you that he intends to leave on it. This initiates a quest timer which affords you 72 hours before the escape window has elapsed. Gene encourages you not to get involved with the surrounding chaos and to prioritize your safety and survival. Gene then departs to gather supplies and the player is free to proceed however they feel, but with the quest timer looming large over their activity.

The quest timer is also a countdown until the end of the game. At the moment the timer elapses, the game ends and an ending occurs. An ending is selected based on an evaluation of the player's activities on Mars up to this point. Unbeknownst to the player, each Optional Quest rewards a point (or negative point) towards each of the game's possible endings. Endings are divided into two categories: Leave or Stay. If Marina has not boarded Gene's rocket by this time, an ending from the Stay category will occur. If Marina has boarded Gene's rocket before the timer ends, the game will end at that moment and an ending from the Leave category will occur. 

  
Optional Quests:
## Letter In A Bottle (Rhea)

'Letter In A Bottle' is an optional quest, but completing it will impact the game's ending. In order to complete Letter In A Bottle, the player must find evidence of Rhea's absence on Ares-622, acquire the Executive Key and enter the Executive Lounge to hear a transmission from Rhea on the Executive Radio Transponder. If the player chooses to save the message to their Torus (personal data device) and leaves Mars, an ending will occur in which Marina is reunited with Rhea on Earth (If Marina Leaves). If the player chooses to delete the message, this quest does not impact the player's ending.

## Shadow Work (Dr Su)
  
'Shadow Work' is an optional quest, but completing it will impact the game's ending. Doctor Su, the chief Psychologist of Ares-622, will insist on Marina "keeping her appointment" by engaging in a talk therapy session once per day. If the player chooses to attend these appointments, Dr Su will attempt to get Marina to open up about her past, her desires and her reason for being on Mars. In order to complete 'Shadow Work', Marina must attend all three sessions and choose whether to speak or remain silent. Speaking during therapy reveals otherwise unknown information about Marina, her sister Melodie, and her decision to leave the Earth. Refusing to speak during therapy increases the odds of getting the 'Long Dark Blues' ending (if Marina Stays).

## Eating The Other (Dr Alma)

'Eating The Other' is an optional quest, but completing it will impact the game's ending. Upon meeting Dr Lu on Level02, she will express to you that she wants to diagnose the mass hysteria by "running a few tests" on one of the masked colonists. She suspects a viral outbreak or parasite is responsible. You may choose whether or not to assist her in capturing an Other for the purposes of examination. Level02 offers a handful of opportunities to lure a masked Other into a cage-trap, at which point you may return to Dr Lu to inform her of a fresh catch. If a subject is captured before the end of Day 2, Dr Lu will have her results on the morning of Day 3. The results are inconclusive.

If you complete this quest, Dr Lu will appear on the launchpad and ask Marina to stay on Mars.

## The Absolute (Old Man)

'The Absolute' is an optional quest, but completing it will impact the game's ending. To complete The Absolute, simply encounter [the Old Man](MrWilhelm) and speak to him at every possible opportunity. If you elect to listen to the entirety of his ramblings, he will deem Marina "not a total idiot" and he will appear on the launchpad later to ask Marina to stay.

## Race For The Prize (Dr Zak)

Level03 is completely sealed off due to a material breach. It is said to be extremely dangerous to enter the de-pressurized area, and some NPCs will discourage the player from entering Level03 at all. If the player chooses to enter Level03, they will meet Dr Zak there and learn that a damaged airlock has flooded the Level with red Martian dust. Dr Zak has elected to seal off the entire floor and quarantine everyone in it to prevent the dangerous space dust from contaminating the rest of the base. Dr Zak is also concerned that exposure to the dust may have poisoned himself and several others, though he is not yet certain of what the dust will do to the human body. He is studying the substance, but is making limited progress due to the low density of the dust. 

Marina may volunteer to wear a spacesuit and exit the damaged airlock into a Martian subterranean mine to find a solid chunk of Martian mineral for Dr Zak to analyze. This quest will lead to Marina delving deeper into a subterranean lava tube in search of a proper specimen. Completing this quest will enable Dr Zak to develop an inoculation against Mars Poisoning and unseal Level03, ending the quarantine and freeing everyone.

If the player completes this quest, Dr Zak will appear on the launchpad and ask Marina to remain on Mars.

## The Other of The Other (Dr Yin)

'The Other of The Other' is an optional quest, but completing it will impact the game's ending. The quest begins if or when the player discovers a mysterious unmarked keycard. The quest can only be completed if the player also discovers the hidden door on Level02 which leads to a secret illegal cloning laboratory. Here, clones of several NPCs can be found in vats, including several clones resembling Dr Su. Dr Yin is found in the heart of the laboratory. At first Dr Yin will order you to leave immediately and forget what you have seen. However, if the player possesses the item `Dr Su's Database`, Dr Yin will confirm the player's suspicion: Dr Su is in fact not a human or a clone, but a hyperrealistic automaton. Dr Yin confesses that her cloning experiments have mostly been in vain, as she is only able to grow dead or comatose copies of human bodies in her laboratory. She used her knowledge of robotics to construct an automaton and coated it with an artificial copy of Dr. Lu's body to create the uncanny Dr Su. This uncanny fleshy automaton was added to the roster of Ares-622 chief scientists and imbued with an experimental artificial intelligence unit and instructed to carry out the will of CHI by psychologically priming the colonists using an experimental treatment, Gemeinschaft Behavioral Therapy (GBT), as a means of social control and personal data collection.

Dr Yin, in a rare personal moment, laments her own biological inability to produce life and refers to Dr Su as "my daughter". She also admits that CHI has ceased to communicate orders to her for the past week and she is considering putting an end to the cloning lab and putting her efforts into building a more sustainable Ares-622 community.

If the player completes this quest, Dr Yin and Dr Su will appear at the Launchpad and ask Marina to stay on Mars.

## Big Data (Alex)

On Level04, Marina meets Alex, a computer engineer who proposes the idea of diagnosing the masked Others by running a statistical analysis of the colonists' personal MDM data. In order to do this, she requires two databases to add to her statistical model. One database is held by Dr Su in her office and the other is held by Officer Kent in the Security HQ. The player can take the elevator back down to Level01 to find these items, but much has changed there since Act 1.

If you complete this quest, Alex will show up on the launchpad to ask Marina to stay.
