#spoilers

Only at the end of the game can Marina’s desire be depicted based on an evaluation of the player’s actions. An ending is selected based on the player’s achievements and Marina’s motivations are retroactively posited based on the outcome of her actions. 

There are four primary endings to the game, two involve staying on Mars and two involve leaving.

| Leave | Stay |
| :----: | :----: |
| Freebird | Long Dark Blues |
| Powerful Love | A Better Tomorrow |

## Main Endings
### Freebird 
Marina leaves Mars with Gene and lives out her life freely on Earth, having learned much about herself. She is no longer fear-haunted or lead by guilt. It is implied that Marina and Gene are briefly in a romantic relationship, but it doesn't last. Marina's Spacefaring license is revoked and she has a new career as a Yoga instructor. Marina muses on all this in a letter to her dead sister, emphasizing that she has no regrets, and that she has learned to take life as it comes. She leaves the letter on her sister's grave.

_Requirements: Meet Gene at Outpost4. Enter his makeshift rocket instead of going back to Ares-622. Do not engage with Rhea's sidequest._

### Powerful Love
Marina leaves Mars with Gene in order to reunite with Rhea on Earth, happily ever after.

_Requirements: Complete Rhea's sidequest, promising that you will return to her on Earth. Meet Gene at Outpost4 and enter his makeshift rocket rather than return to Ares-622. Optionally, tell him you're gay when he hits on you._

### Long Dark Blues
Marina elects to stay on Mars and decides that her fate is to become one of "[the Others](LogosPathogenesis.md)", to delve into the abyss and finally find inner peace. Looking into the mirror, she dons the Domino mask and loses herself forever.\

_Requirements: Complete less than two sidequests and decline Dr. Su's therapy sessions. Alternatively, complete the [Other Place](OtherPlace.md) sidequest by asserting your intention to join "the Others". Gaze into the mirror in the restroom at Outpost4._

### A Better Tomorrow
Marina elects to stay on Mars after being persuaded by several colonists who express appreciation towards her. Marina has become a beloved member of the community and finds meaning in building a better world with her compatriots.

_Requirements: Complete 6 or more sidequests. Alternatively, complete the [Spectre Haunting Mars](Spectre.md) sidequest by persuading the subject matter experts to attend a meeting on the founding of a [provisional government](APG.md). Finally, go to Outpost4 to restore the power grid and return to Ares-622 rather than join Gene on his rocket._

### Secret Endings
These are some cheeky endings that can only be unlocked by completing amazing feats. Only the real Marina fans are likely to discover these.
#### No One Will Ever Love You
Marina slyly finds a shortcut to the 4th level and single-mindedly sprints to the launchpad in record time, leaving Mars and Gene behind.
