> The human being is this night, this empty nothing, that contains everything in its simplicity - an unending wealth of many representations, images, of which none belongs to him - or which are not present. This night, the interior of nature, that exists here - pure self - in phantasmagorical representations, is night all around it, in which here shoots a bloody head - there another white ghastly apparition, suddenly here before it, and just so disappears. One catches sight of this night when one looks human beings in the eye - into a night that becomes awful.
>-G.W.F. Hegel

**
During the first week of operation on Ares-622, several colonists begin wearing [a sensory deprivation mask](<Domino>) during their waking hours, rendering them unable to communicate or do their duties.  These mask-wearing colonists have effectively othered themselves from the population of Ares-622. Their TORUS devices display an error message not present in any documentation: `Subject_Commenced_Designification`


Proposed Explanations for Logos Pathogenesis:

- Mass Psychosis: The Wellness Department broadcasts that what is happening is a widespread mental condition that must be treated with bedrest. The implementation of prescription drugs is tested on Level01.

- Wildcat Strike: Although there is no evidence that this mass action was pre-meditated or that any demands are being made, it does effectively bring production to a halt while making negotiations with worker-colonists impossible. Some may feel that the event is a pointed refusal of working conditions on Ares-622.

- Mind Control: Rumors circulate that the high-tech Domino mask worn by the others is causing brainwave interference that influences behavior. It is theorized that CHI intended to test this method of control on colonists or otherwise deprive them of their free will.

- Brain Parasite: Another rumor posits that an invisible alien parasite is infecting colonists one by one. People who believe this will lock themselves away and distance themselves from others, believing the parasite to be spread by proximity.

- The Spirit Of Mars: Certain people with a spiritual background believe that the planet Mars itself has a will of its own. They believe that a planet’s electromagnetic fields influence living things and the Others are simply the first to undergo metamorphosis from what they call `Earthen Humanity` into an evolved `Martian Human`. 

- Patient Zero: Marina’s quiet demeanor and seeming unwillingness to speak (which predates her arrival on Mars) has similarities to the symptoms of the masked Others. This makes some colonists suspect that she has something to do with what is happening, some even believing she carries an airborne contagion. These people may shun Marina or attempt to apprehend her.

**The emergence of the `masked Others` is an inevitable, inexplicable side-effect of human activity on Mars and the true objective of the Wellness Department is to observe it. The data collected by the TORUS system is intended to inform a diagnosis of the mysterious phenomena, designated `Logos Pathogenesis` in internal CHI memos. Ares-622 is the 22nd in a series of failed colonies, with all prior attempts ending in madness and death for the colonists. Due to the secretive nature of CHI’s recruiting and colonial activity on Mars, the disappearance of these colonists has thus far been a well-kept secret on Earth.**
