#Character 

The Old Man, sometimes referred to as Mr. Wilhelm, is a mysterious man who resides on Ares-622 despite having no apparent position or documentation to justify his presence. He has no assigned dormitory and it can be deduced that he sleeps in The Squatter's Residence on [Level00](Level00.md). He can be found throughout the base, offering cryptic advice to Marina.

### MADNESS
Mr Wilhelm is losing his mind. Two months ago he had been a highly valued executive at CHI undergoing a top secret brain augmentation that would initiate him into [the highest ranks of his peers](TELOS.md). Unfortunately, the operation was botched and resulted in a traumatic brain injury. To avoid any secrets being made public, an unconscious Mr Wilhelm was jettisoned to Mars in the cargo bay. That is where he awoke, able-bodied and capable of speech, but unable to communicate intelligibly with his fellow colonists. Babbling about accelerated brain activity and secret societies, lacking valid identification, he is completely ignored. Only Marina cares to listen to what he has to say. Mr Wilhelm is the only homeless man on Ares-622. On Earth, the authorities have declared Mr Wilhelm missing, presumed dead.

### ASSOCIATION WITH TELOS
At one point Mr. Wilhelm was among the ranks of [TELOS](TELOS.md). It is assumed that he may have suffered a traumatic brain injury due to a botched brain augmentation, which would explain his indecipherable ranting. Presumably he wanders Ares-622 because he has been abandoned by TELOS and deemed a non-threat. However, he has not gone completely mad. A patient and astute listener may glean critical information about TELOS by hearing him out.
