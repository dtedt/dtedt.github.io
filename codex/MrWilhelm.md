#Character 

The Old Man, sometimes referred to as Mr. Wilhelm, is a mysterious man who resides on Ares-622 despite having no apparent position or documentation to justify his presence. He has no assigned dormitory and it can be deduced that he sleeps in The Squatter's Residence on [Level00](Level00.md). He can be found throughout the base, offering cryptic advice to Marina.

### ASSOCIATION WITH TELOS
At one point Mr. Wilhelm was among the ranks of [TELOS](TELOS.md). It is assumed that he may have suffered a traumatic brain injury due to a botched brain augmentation, which would explain his indecipherable ranting. Presumably he wanders Ares-622 because he has been abandoned by TELOS and deemed a non-threat. However, he has not gone completely mad. A patient and astute listener may glean critical information about TELOS by hearing him out.
