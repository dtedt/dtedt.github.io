### Luna ACT 1

“There was a star riding through clouds one night, & I said to the star, 'Consume me'.”
― Virginia Woolf

# EXT - Dreamscape
_An endless blue sea stretches out in all directions, cresting into foam and backslides. The waves
merge quietly, then crush each other loudly. We see nothing but the waves for a time, abstract
forms of water loudly merging…_

_We can hear woman’s breath, heard through a helmet mic._

_The soggy image of a hand, gloved in a tight spacesuit mesh on a blood red background,
reaching out desperately. The breaths become more shallow, more desperate._

# EXT - Dreamscape
_A BLUE GIRL is walking in the electric orange haze. (There is a prompt to move with WASD
controls.)_

**GIRL**: Help.

_**MARINA** is standing in the middle of the seascape in athletic gear, tightly holding a beach towel.
The waves are gathering around her, consuming the background._

GIRL: I can’t remember where.

We see a young girls face in a space helmet, cracked and filled with water. Her eyes are black.
Cut to seagulls passing over a summer sun. A warning klaxon cries in the distance
GIRL: Help.
We see MARINA, her fist pressed against the glass like barrier of water. The shallow breaths are
now arrested breathing.
GIRL: Help.
MARINA’s whole face in frame, screaming.
Cut to MARINA and THE GIRL IN THE SPACESUIT floating in the sea, an invisibile barrier
between them.
GIRL: Help.
We see the GIRL’s face again, black blood boiling from her eyes and the sides of her jaw, her
mouth open impossibly wide.
GIRL: Marina!
EXT - Mare Serenitatis, Luna
Marina hunched over in her spacesuit, on the lunar surface.
RADIO: Marina! Overwatch to Roadrunner Flight! Overwatch to Roadrunner Flight! Come in
please. Overwatch to Roadrunner! Yuri, Marina, please come in!
MARINA stands herself up.
MARINA: Roadrunner 2 to Overwatch. We had a collision. Yuri’s injured. I think I can get to him.
RADIO: Negative Roadrunner. We have red lights on your suit. Run diagnostic.
MARINA clips into the TOURS interface. Information about her body and her suit flash across
the screen, all looking good.
MARINA: TOURS check. Suit integrity GREEN. O2 GREEN. Vitals GREEN.
RADIO: We read you GREEN Roadrunner. SITREP.
MARINA: Our rover hit something, Yuri and I got flipped out. We’re separated. I need to..
RADIO: Negative Roadrunner. We can’t risk turning one casualty into two. Stand By.
MARINA walks around on the surface for a spell, gathering herself.
RADIO: Do you have a visual on the rover or Morozov?
MARINA: Copy Overwatch. I have a line of sight on both of them. Uploading telemetry now.
RADIO: Receiving Roadrunner. We’re patching you to Medical.
Dr. Harris: This is Flight Surgeon Harris, Marina. Let me walk you through this. Follow the cursor
to Morozov and sync your TOURS when you’re in sensor range. Do not touch or move him.
Copy?
MARINA: Solid copy, Doctor. Making my way to Morozov now.
MARINA walks to the crash site, YURI MOROZOV is face down on the lunar surface in his
spacesuit and a TRAINING ROVER is tipped on its side. MARINA syncs the her TOURS with his
spacesuit. Data filters in…
MARINA: TOURS check. Suit integrity AUXILLARY. O2 GREEN. Vitals YELLOW. Uploading data.
He looks unconscious.
HARRIS: Package received, Roadrunner. Leave the diagnosis to us and stand by.
MARINA approaches YURI carefully.
MARINA: I’ve got you Yuri. You’re going home.
HARRIS: Vitals are clear for evac, can you get him onto the rover Roadrunner?
MARINA: Copy. I’m right next to him.
HARRIS: Get Morozov onto the rover. Standby.
MARINA lifts YURI and kicks the rover upright.
HARRIS: We have all your telemetry Roadrunner, stand by. He’s concussed, we need to keep him
awake before trauma can get to him. Reset the suit pressure in TOURS.
MARINA: Copy.
MARINA scrolls through the TOURS interface and resets YURI’s suit until the readout is green.
We can hear YURI wincing…
MARINA: Yuri’s GREEN. Rover’s GREEN. What am I doing Overwatch?
HARRIS: Copy Roadrunner, we have you on the board. Trauma team is waiting at GATE WINTER.
Proceed to coordinates and keep him talking. We need to keep him awake.
MARINA: Copy Overwatch, Keeping Morozov talking won’t be a problem.
YURI: Bloody Americans.
MARINA: Nice to see you too, Yuri.
MARINA proceeds to ride the rover over the silver-grey sea of LUNA, following a navigation icon.
YURI: I’m sorry.
MARINA: Stop. You didn’t do anything wrong.
YURI: I didn’t do anything right either. That was sloppy.
MARINA: You can make it up to me in the Op Lounge.
YURI: I heard you screaming on the radio. Are you alright?
MARINA: I just had the wind knocked out of me. I’m fine, Yuri.
YURI: We shouldn’t be here. This place. It’s not something for life.
MARINA: Where’s home?
YURI: Kaliningrad. You should come with me.
MARINA: Oh really?
YURI: The sea is so clean there. Perfect. My wife would take care of you, Marina.
MARINA: What’s she like.
YURI: Round and warm. Like fresh dough in the sunshine.
MARINA: I see.
YURI: Perfect. I don’t know why I came here.
MARINA approaches the MOON BASE. A LARGE AIRLOCK faces the rover crew.
MARINA: We’re here. Hold on Yuri.
YURI: …
RADIO: Overwatch Actual to Roadrunner. Stand by docking.
HARRIS: We’ve got red lights on Morozov, what’s happening?
MARINA: Yuri? Yuri! Stay with me!
RADIO: Docking PDI. Docking GREEN.
The rover drives itself into the airlock hold. A group of medical staff in bright yellow spacesuits
intercept the rover and take Yuri.
HARRIS: We’ve got him! Get a crash cart here, we’ve got a breach.
MARINA: I was just talking to him! Yuri!
HARRIS: Get her out of here!
RADIO: Stand by for DMP protocol.
Alarm klaxons blare in the background. The airlock floods with fog…
INT - MOONBASE QUATERS
MARINA is in her civilian gear on a treadmill in a messy room. Dr. Harris enters.
HARRIS: Sorry to let myself in. We need to talk.
MARINA Sits at a desk with Dr. Harris.
HARRIS: Morozov is stable. He had a cracked skull and some inter-cranial bleeding that we can’t
treat here, but he’s lucky to be alive.
MARINA: …
HARRIS: We’re sending him home, he’s done on Luna station.
MARINA: Can I talk to him?
HARRIS: No, I’m sorry we have to keep him under until the shuttle arrives.
MARINA: I can’t leave him in the airlock in my head, Harris. I just want to see him.
HARRIS: You saved his life Marina. Guess that comes with some privileges.
MARINA: Yeah, guess so.
HARRIS: Head to Medbay. Greer wants to talk to you.
INT - MEDBAY
MARINA sits next to a medical pod with Yuri.
MARINA: I looked up Kaliningrad. Beautiful like you said. Everyone looked really well fed, I don’t
know how you got up here so skinny. We had a beach near me, too. It’s easy to forget what they
are when you live so close. Thanks for everything.
DIRECTOR GREER enters the medical bay.
GREER: They said I could find you here. Good work today.
MARINA: Thank you, Director.
GREER: We cleared you. It was an accident and you weren’t even driving.
MARINA: Yuri…
GREER: It’s up to the board. With his license… It could go either way.
MARINA: If there’s anything I can do, Greer. He’s a good pilot. That sink came out of nowhere.
GREER: I read your report. Like I said, it’s not up to me.
MARINA: …
GREER: We’ve approved your transfer to Tereshkova.
MARINA: What?
GREER: Outbound 4456, next week.
MARINA: I thought it was in review.
GREER: Me too, somebody bumped it up. It’s been nice working with you.
MARINA: That’s it. Yuri and I almost die out there and now I’ve got my ticket.
GREER: This isn’t about the crash Marina. You were requested by name, I approved the transfer.
There’s room on Yuri’s shuttle if you’re nervous. Most people would kill for this post.
MARINA: I’m not going back. I’ll be there.
GREER: Understood. Good afternoon.
MARINA Lingers in the medbay, the sound of crashing waves enter through room, bells ringing
in the distance.
GIRL IN SPACESUIT: Help. Help. Help…
END
Cabin - INT
The soft glow of the TOURS divine floods the room with light, a notification charm beeping
steadily
Svet - Marina. Are you awake.
M- Hello?
Svet- This is Vasilii’s wife, we met awhile ago. We need to talk.
M - …
Svet - Not on the TORUS. They’re listening. Met me at GATE WINTER. I’ve overridden the door
security, so you can move past the lights out.
M- Who is listening?
Svet- He trusted you, so I trust you. Don’t make me regret it. I’ll be waiting at GATE WINTER.
*click*
M- …
MARINA is on a walk through the silent halls of the moonbase…
GATE WINTER - INT
V- What happened to him?
M- Our rover overturned, his suit breached and we had to carry him back. They never told you?
V- They won’t even let me into the medical section, security reasons.
M- He’s in a stasis pod. I saw him stable. Sorry V.
V- You got that promotion to Mars, didn’t you. You’re close to Pike?
M- Where is this going V?
V- You need to get me access to the TORUS network. Vi was working on something, he switched
off his terminal because he was worried about the survellience. Don’t you see? Right before the
crash.
M- I’m sorry about Vi, but I’m not going to… What are you even asking me.
V- He said you were smart, maybe he just thought you were pretty.
M- Good night, specialist.
V- Wait. They won’t even let me on the rover for repairs. I’m a ghost here. Just some closure
Marina. Please. The TORUS has protocols that can be overridden, let me show you.
*Switch over to TORUS*
I’ve made a secure network that we can talk on. You’ll talk to Pike tommrow, yes? Just find out
what he knows and speak to me privately. That’s all. No conspiracy, just some closure. I just
want to know what happened to my husband.
M- What makes you think he told me anything, Svet? We hardly saw each other. I don’t even…
(Beat) Okay. You call it. What’s your plan?
V- We’re going to work on the rover off-shift tommrow, stop by and staff off the main network
until then. I’m just asking for you to stay off for a night, please. I’ll show you.
M- One day, Svet. One day and that’s it.
V- Very well, I suppose that is all you should be capable of. Congratulations on your promotion,
Marina.
M- Svetlana. I’m sorry.
