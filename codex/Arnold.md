#Character 

**Arnold is either experiencing a paranoid episode or he’s privy to something no one else could have anticipated. He has discarded all of the furniture in his room and gouged the walls and floors for listening devices, a la The Conversation (1974). Arnold is under the impression that Ares-622 is not in fact on Mars, but instead on a soundstage in Nevada where the government is attempting to force a confession out of him through an elaborate ruse. To complete Arnold’s quest, you must present him with an item that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are on Mars.**
