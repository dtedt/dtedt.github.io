#Character 

**Arnold** is either experiencing a paranoid episode or he’s privy to something no one else could have anticipated. He has discarded all of the furniture in his room and gouged the walls and floors for listening devices, a la The Conversation (1974). Arnold is under the impression that Ares-622 is not in fact on Mars, but instead on a soundstage in Nevada where the government is attempting to force a confession out of him through an elaborate ruse. To complete Arnold’s quest, you must present him with an item that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are on Mars.

## Quest
In order to help Arnold move past his paranoid preoccupation, you must present him with an item which proves unequivically that you are on Mars and not a sophisticated simulation of it. You can show him any of the items in your inventory to achieve this, but Arnold has a sound explanation for everything. If you show him a rock from the Martian surface, he will insist that it is a prop made of dyed sulphur. If you show him Dr Alma's research findings, he will insist that they were probably generated by a Hollywood screenwriting AI. If you show him the Domino mask used for interstellar travel, he'll comment that it is in fact a brainwashing device created by the American government. 

Arnold will deny the possibility of being on Mars no matter what you show him, his paranoid delusion is airtight. However, the quest can be completed by showing Arnold the love letter addressed to him, found on his desk on Level04. Upon reading this Arnold will admit that, while he remains certain that there is a conspiracy against him, it's possible that maybe he shouldn't be sitting alone in his room 24/7. Arnold announces that he will take a shower and go for a walk. Progress!
