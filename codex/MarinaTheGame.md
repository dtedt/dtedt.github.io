**Marina** is a dark comedy which follows the story of Marina, a newly arrived colonist on the first-ever Mars colony [Ares-622](Ares-622.md). 

After enduring personal tragedy on Earth and [an accident on the Moon](Luna.md), Marina agrees to move to [Mars](Mars.md) and work as a Wellness Expert on [Ares-622](Ares-622.md), where she will be conducting physical therapy and personalized training routines for the colony's [community of scientists and researchers](Departments.md). However, soon after her arrival, something strange occurs. An alarming number of colonists have [inexplicably](LogosPathogenesis.md) taken to wearing [masks](Domino.md) and silently loitering around the colony, refusing to speak or attend to their assigned duties. Though peaceful at first, this inevitably results in acts of violence as Ares-622's [Security Team](SecurityDept.md) becomes desperate to maintain control and quash this mysterious rebellion. To make matters worse, without the essential workers needed to keep the base functioning, [power outages and assorted malfunctions](Chaos.md) are occurring everywhere, making Ares-622 increasingly dangerous and putting everyone's survival in jeopardy.

In the midst of all this chaos, Marina must face up to her past, take control of her life and make [a big decision](Endings.md). Will she escape from Mars? Or will she stay and help build a new kind of society?
