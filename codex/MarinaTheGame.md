**Marina** is a philosophical suspense thriller which follows the story of Marina, a newly arrived colonist on the first-ever Mars colony [Ares-622]. 

After enduring personal tragedy on Earth and an accident on the Moon, Marina agrees to move to [Mars](Mars.md) and work as a Wellness Expert, where she will be conducting physical therapy and personalized training routines for the colony's community of scientists and researchers. However, soon after her arrival, something strange occurs. An alarming number of colonists have inexplicably taken to wearing masks and silently loitering around the colony, refusing to speak or attend to their assigned duties. Though peaceful at first, this inevitably results in acts of violence as Ares-622's Security Team becomes desperate to maintain control and quash this mysterious rebellion. To make matters worse, without the essential workers needed to keep the base functioning, power outages and assorted malfunctions are occurring everywhere, making Ares-622 increasingly dangerous and putting everyone's survival in jeopardy.

In the midst of all this chaos, Marina must face up to her past, take control of her life and make a big decision. Will she escape from Mars? Or will she stay and help build a new kind of society?
