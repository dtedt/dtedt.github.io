#Character 

**Marina** is the player-character. At first Marina has no apparent desire or motivation, but through the player's actions as Marina, she will traverse the Mars base [Ares-622](Ares-622.md), complete some [Quests](Quests.md) and reach one of several [Endings](Endings.md), ultimately [fulfilling her desire](Retroactivity.md).

Marina is a quiet, reserved character who has come to Ares-622 to serve as it's Physical Wellness Coordinator. During her first week there, [a disaster](LogosPathogenesis.md) occurs. She must then decide whether to escape from Mars and return to Earth, or to stay on Mars and help build a thriving post-colonial society against all odds. Using her [TORUS device](TORUS.md)

### Mourning or Melancholia or Something Stranger?
_Marina: Red_ picks up immediately after Marina is unceremoniously informed of her sister's death (at the end of _Marina: Blue_). Marina, who left Earth to break free of her obligations toward her sister, elects not to return to Earth, leaving no one to arrange a funeral or proper burial rites for her sister. Marina's journey to Mars marks the beginning of a period of despondency, guilt and mourning for Marina.
Similar to the alcoholic protagonist of Disco Elysium, Marina's behavior throughout the game will determine how her story is [recounted at the end of the game](Endings.md). Was she doomed from the beginning to ultimately submit to despair? Did a tendency toward initiative in spite of her condition enable her to rise to the occasion? Or 

### Connection to [the disaster](LogosPathogenesis.md)
Before donning the mask, victims of ["Logos Pathogenesis"](LogosPathogenesis.md) exhibit a brief stage of mutism. Marinaâ€™s introverted, soft-spoken nature makes her a candidate for suspicion. Colonists familiar with the symptom will be apprehensive of Marina for this reason. Marina herself may feel concerned that she may be becoming "one of them". 
In endings A, B, C and D Marina moves on from her mute depression and is vindicated from association with the outbreak. In ending E, Marina submits to despair and dons the mask, thinking that it is her fate. This outcome could be interpreted as a self-fulfilling prophesy.
