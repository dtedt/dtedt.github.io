#Character 

**Marina** is the player-character. At first Marina has no apparent desire or motivation on [Mars](Mars.md), but through the player's actions as Marina, she will traverse the Mars base [Ares-622](Ares-622.md), complete some [Quests](Quests.md) and reach one of several [Endings](Endings.md), fulfilling her desire.

Marina is a quiet, reserved character who has come to Ares-622 to serve as it's Physical Wellness Coordinator. During her first week there, [a disaster](LogosPathogenesis.md) occurs. She must then decide whether to escape from Mars and return to Earth, or to stay on Mars and help build a thriving post-colonial society against all odds. Using her [TORUS device](TORUS.md)

### Connection to [Logos](LogosPathogenesis.md)
Before donning the mask, victims of [Logos](LogosPathogenesis.md) exhibit a brief stage of mutism. Marinaâ€™s introverted, soft-spoken nature makes her a candidate for suspicion. Colonists familiar with the symptom will be apprehensive of Marina for this reason. Marina herself may feel concerned that she may be becoming "one of them". 

In endings A, B, C and D Marina moves on from her mute depression and is vindicated from association with the outbreak. In ending E, Marina submits to despair and dons the mask, thinking that it is her fate. This outcome could be interpreted as a self-fulfilling prophesy.
