**Departments**:

**Biology Dept.**


 The Biology Department has multiple functions: the development of agriculture in the Greenhouse to supplement the base’s food and medical supplies, the refinement of chemicals used for various purposes throughout the base and the study of biological changes undergone by the colonists on Mars. Biology’s Chief Science Officer is Doctor Alma Lucretzia. 
Unbeknownst to the colonists, there are two additional projects managed on LEVEL02: Cloning research and a search for microscopic lifeforms living in the planet’s sediment deposits.

**Geology Dept.**

The Geology Department on LEVEL03 is seemingly devoted to the study of the Martian environment and its hazardous minerals, but it is also secretly the seat of CHI’s illegal mining operation. Doctor Zakariah is its Chief Science Officer and his first priority is to study the caustic micro-dust of Mars and engineer ways of protecting the colony from the possibility of direct contact with it. 
On Day 3, a material breach leads to all entrances to LEVEL03 being hermetically sealed, preventing entry. If Marina enters Level03 on Day 2 she will have the opportunity to save the entire base from certain destruction by entering the subterranean lava caverns and collecting a special mineral sample in the Lava Tubes which Doctor Zak can process into an inoculation against Mars Poisoning.

**Information Science Dept.**

The Information Science department on Level04 is where all non-research data (surveillance, identification, work orders, resource management) is collated and processed. The department is supposedly directed by Dr Yin, though she is mysteriously not attentive to her duties there. 
The absence of leadership is felt in the ad-hoc social environment on Level04, where computer scientists and masked Others coexist in disorganized harmony despite their inability to communicate with one another. A data analyst named Alex is the only remaining member of the IS department continuing to take her job seriously after chaos reigns over the base. This is also where Gene surreptitiously runs his cryptocurrency operation, which is the true cause of the power failure that occurs at the end of Day 1.

**Wellness Dept.**

The Wellness Department includes three wings: Mental Wellness (directed by Dr Su), Medical Wellness (directed by Dr Bhat) and Physical Wellness (directed by Marina). It is mainly based on Level01, but there are also wellness centers on each level for first aid and therapy appointments. The TORUS system automatically collects and analyzes data from the colonists’ vital signs and makes automated judgments regarding prescription regimens, fitness plans, dietary restrictions and more.
Although Wellness may appear at first to be little more than a glorified “Nurse’s Office” to colonists, it is secretly the core research team of Ares-622. The colonists of Ares-622 are unwittingly considered test subjects by CHI and the data collected by the Wellness Department is in fact the meat of the project, as this test data will inform CHI’s future colonial endeavors on Mars and other planets. 
 
## Ancillary Departments
Ancillary Departments are departments necessitated to support infrastructure on Ares-622 and enable the Main Departments to function on a day-to-day basis.

Security Department
The Security Department exists to deter disobedience or unanticipated violence on-base. Led by Chief Masaki, Security personnel are authorized to use physical force if necessary in their role as disciplinarians and conflict mediators. Security has access to a special database of criminal records not available to the other departments
On Day 1, Chief Masaki exhibits signs of mutism and ultimately dons the mask on Day 2, becoming an Other. This creates a crisis of leadership within Security. Officer Kent ultimately assumes control and implements a zero tolerance policy for mask-wearing, resulting in the arrest and confinement of countless masked Others on Level01.

## Secret Projects/Conspiracies

Cloning Laboratory

Dr Yin’s absence from her duties on Level04 is due to her feverish work in a secret laboratory between Level02 and Level03. She is working night and day to perfect a method of full-body human fabrication (not to be confused with reproductive cloning), under secret orders from CHI leadership. The Cloning Lab is adorned with various occult objects which suggest that Dr Yin’s obsession and experiments are not entirely rational, however there is eerie evidence of some modest success in replicating a human being.

Illegal Off-world Mining

A fleet of unmanned aerial drones scan the terrain for ore deposits while an army of subterranean mining mechs dig tunnels, collect resources and package payloads in anticipation of the completion of CHI’s space elevator for transport. Marina may encounter such a mech on Level03 and commandeer it to complete her mission. There may even be a subterranean route to Outpost4…

Logos Pathogenesis

The emergence of the `masked Others` is an inevitable, inexplicable side-effect of human activity on Mars and the true objective of the Wellness Department is to observe it. The data collected by the TORUS system is intended to inform a diagnosis of the mysterious phenomena, designated `Logos Pathogenesis` in internal CHI memos. Ares-622 is the 22nd in a series of failed colonies, with all prior attempts ending in madness and death for the colonists. Due to the secretive nature of CHI’s recruiting and colonial activity on Mars, the disappearance of these colonists has thus far been a well-kept secret on Earth.
	
Proposed Explanations for Logos Pathogenesis:

Mass Psychosis: The Wellness Department regards what is happening as a mental condition that must be treated with bedrest. The implementation of prescription drugs is explored.

Mind Control: Rumors circulate that the high-tech Domino mask worn by the others is causing brainwave interference that influences behavior.

The Spirit Of Mars: Some believe that the planet Mars itself has a will of its own. They believe that a planet’s electromagnetic fields influence living things and the Others are simply the first to undergo metamorphosis from Earthen Humanity into an evolved Martian.

Brain Parasite: Another rumor posits that an invisible alien parasite is infecting colonists one by one.

Patient Zero?: Marina’s quiet demeanor and seeming unwillingness to speak (which predates her arrival on Mars) has similarities to the symptoms of the Others. This makes some colonists suspect that she has something to do with what is happening, some even believing she carries some sort of contagion.

???

The true long-term goals of CHI’s venture into off-world colonies is mysterious. CHI’s mining operations are the real source of value, and the establishment of human colonies is a huge cost for CHI, with no apparent profit on the horizon. It is rumored that the design and implementation of Ares colonies on Mars is directed by a mythic group of benefactors known only as Telos.
