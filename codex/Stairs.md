**The Stairwells**

The Stairwells are a maintenence corridor facilitating access between floors on [Ares-622](Ares-622.md) when the [Elevator](Elevator.md) is unavailable.

## Between Level00 and Level01
The main Elevator does not go to [Level00](Level00.md), so this stairwell is the only way to descend into the Engine Room and Ruth's Maintenence Office. It is accessible using the Freewily by copying permissions from Security.

## Between Level01 and Level02
Immediately following the first power outage, Marina will enter this stairwell in order to escape to the Greenhouse on Level02.

## Between Level02 and Level03
The Security Team has setup a checkpoint here to prevent masked Others from migrating upwards. If Marina attempts to pass through here, she will be subject to a search and if she is found with any suspicious items (such as a Domino mask or a Freewily app installed on her TORUS), she may be arrested and sent back to Level01. This is also where [Level??](Level??.md) can be accessed through occult means.

## Between Level03 and Level04
This stairwell is typically unnecessary to use since the [Elevator](Elevator.md) should be repaired by the time Marina reaches this point, but this is the location of the hidden entrance to [the secret Cloning Laboratory](CloneLab.md) on [LevelXX](LevelXX.md).
