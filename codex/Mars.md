## Time on Mars
>For the purpose of this comparison, we use the solar longitude range 0°-360° to define a Mars year and adopt April 11, 1955 (Ls=0°) as the beginning of year 1. In this arbitrary convention, the Mariner 9, Viking, Phobos, and Pathfinder missions occurred in years 9-10, 12-15, 19-20, and 23, respectively. By comparison, the 1992-1999 Earth-based millimeter observations extend over years 21-24, and the 1997-1999 Mars Global Surveyor TES observations extend over years 23 and 24. (Clancy et al., 2000)
