*TELOS* is a secret conspiratorial organization formed by top shareholders of [Cardosa Heavy Industries](CHI.md).

Unbeknownst to all but a few, these individuals are among the first human subjects to successfully undergo brain augmentation, granting them expansive mental processing power and memory. Believing themselves to be the most intelligent lifeforms in the galaxy and capable of special insights into the nature of the universe, they have orchestrated the founding of Ares-622 as part of their secret philosophical goals for the future of humanity.

At one point [Mr. Wilhelm](MrWilhelm.md) was among their ranks. It is assumed that he may have suffered a traumatic brain injury due to a botched brain augmentation, which would explain his indecipherable ranting. Presumably he wanders Ares-622 because he has been abandoned by TELOS and deemed a non-threat. However, he has not gone completely mad. A patient and astute listener may glean critical information about TELOS by hearing him out.
