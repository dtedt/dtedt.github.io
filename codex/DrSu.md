**Doctor Susan Lucretzia** Is the Wellness Lead on Ares-622. Dr Su bears a striking resemblance to [Dr Lu](DrAlma.md) and it is implied that they are in fact identical twins. Oddly, there is a palpable lack of rapport between them, as if they had only met yesterday and don’t get along. Dr Su practices mandatory talk therapy sessions with the staff of Ares-622 and Marina will be required to attend a scheduled session at the end of Day 1 where Dr Su will probe Marina about her emotional state. To complete this quest, attend all three talk therapy sessions and have a breakthrough regarding Marina’s past.
