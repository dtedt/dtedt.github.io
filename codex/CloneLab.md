**Secret Cloning Laboratory**


Dr Yin’s absence from her duties on Level04 is due to her feverish work in a secret laboratory between Level03 and Level04. She is working night and day to perfect a method of full-body human fabrication (not to be confused with reproductive cloning), under secret orders from CHI leadership. The Cloning Lab is adorned with various occult objects which suggest that Dr Yin’s obsession and experiments are not entirely rational, however there is eerie evidence of some modest success in replicating a human being.
