MARINA: DAY ZERO

### Game Design Document (GDD): Marina: Day Zero

The goal of M:DZ is to orient the player in the world of Marina while creating a digestible workload for the O4 team and our contractors. I tried to balance story notes from Ted’s original concept while creating a story that can serve as a stand alone adventure with its own environment and characters.

Dynamic lighting and sound effects will play a large role in setting the scene and pathfinding the player in the space. We also need to be mindful of the sound and light properties in regards to the exterior and interior environments. Light on the moon should be filled and almost desaturating.

Players who play the proper MARINA game should not have to play DZ to understand the main game, but they will have a leg up on the lore and gameplay loos if they do.

The Moonbase, tentatively named LUNA STATION, will serve as a more professional and low stakes area to explore and interact with, so we should take reasonable steps to make sure LUNA feels close to, but not exactly like the Mars base.

#### Dramatis Personae

**Marina:** Our heroine. Late 20s, Asian American woman with a tall athletic build. Civilian astronaut-in-training with a physical trainer certification. Melancholy and observational.

**Vasilii Morozov:** Early 40s. Male. Russian ex-test pilot and instructor with a stocky frame. He’s working with Marina to help get her qualified for EVA work. Friendly and philosophical.

**Svetlana Morozov:** 30s, female. Russian mech mechanic with a thin build. Came to work and live with Vasilii on the moonbase. Cynical and technically gifted. Her husband’s grievous injuries and the lack of transparency drive her to ask for Marina’s help to find the truth of the crash.

**Jackie Devin:** Early 20s female, American fitness instructor with a swimmer’s body. Former Olympic volleyball player taking a contract to work on the base’s gym. Extroverted and curious. Very much a SoCal beach bum out of water.

**CMO Dr. Malcolm:** Late 30s, Arab-Canadian woman. CMO on the moonbase. Professional and precise. A career astronaut who has made a life in space, she has worked on the station longer than anyone. Runs the medbay as a private fiefdom.

**CMDR Donald Pike:** 50s, Black-British male. Lean and fit former Royal Navy commander. Cold warrior turned astronaut commander, Pike is the public face of the largest lunar base and fits the part. Keeps a balance between the departments and Earth’s various governments and private missions.

**Lt. CMDR Lisa Collins:** Late 30s, African-American female. Career civilian astronaut, second-in-command on the base, Mission Control if you’re being informal. Cynical and ill-tempered, constantly bristles against her bureaucratic duties and keeping the base running smoothly. Maintains the TORUS network.

**LT. Colin Green:** 20s, German-American. Rotund. Lead communications officer on the moonbase. Quiet and messy. Runs an underground rave in GATE SUMMER in his off time.

**CPO Richard Stockard:** 40s, American. Built like a retired football player. Chief technician on the moonbase. Loud and hardworking. Bickers with Svetlana over maintenance issues. In charge of all EVA-rated equipment and vehicles.

**Yasmin Al-Hosani:** 20s, Arab woman. A lean, aristocratic frame. UAE socialite and executive representative for CHI on the moonbase. Diplomatic and formal. She’s assessing Marina during her orientation for the ARES mission.

#### Plot

**Act 1**
- **Introduction:** Dream sequence where Marina relives the trauma of losing her sister in the ocean, transitions to:
- **Crash Site:** Marina tipped over in an ejection seat on the lunar surface, with her rover overturned. She frees herself, gets Vasilii, and gets the rover operational.
- **Rescue:** Marina drives the rover to get back to the moonbase with minutes to spare before Vasilii dies from his injuries.
- **Recovery:** Marina is back in the medical bay, being examined by the CMO. She asks questions about herself and Vasilii. She takes some time to talk to him while he is in a coma. Dismissed back to her cabin.
- **Exploration:** Marina can walk around the promenade in her downtime and talk to some people in the common area before going to sleep.
- **Secret Meeting:** While sleeping, Marina is woken up with an off-network message from Svetlana, asking her to meet in GATE WINTER privately. Marina walks through a dark and lonely moonbase to get into WINTER’s back entrance and meet with Svetlana.
- **Confession:** Svetlana confides in Marina. She reveals that they won’t let her see her husband in the medbay or work on the rover. She asks for Marina’s help to find more information and shares her suspicions about TORUS’ surveillance features, noting that Vasilii had jailbroken his. Marina learns how to access the backend of the TORUS device.
- **End of Act 1**

**Act 2**
- **Promotion:** Marina learns about her promotion to the ARES mission, begins her investigation into the rover crash, and interacts with her crewmates.
- **Gym Class:** Marina starts her shift at the gym, leading a HIIT/Kickboxing class. Rhythm game mechanics where players match movements with Jackie, and get graded at the end. If players elect to take a run before the class, they can increase their rank.
- **Rave Invitation:** Jackie tells Marina about the rave at GATE SPRING later that night and shares info on the private DM channel.
- **Investigation:** Marina heads to GATE WINTER to meet with Svetlana and Stockard to get a crash report. They learn that Vasilii’s TORUS was disconnected from the network and that the navigation software had an error that led them to an area with exposed liquid nitrogen deposits, causing the near-fatal crash.
- **Command Meeting:** Marina responds to a call from the command deck and meets with Collins and Pike. She’s being transferred to the ARES crew with CHI and has her civilian astronaut rating fast-tracked. Marina can ask for details about the crash and get political, stonewalling answers from Pike and Collins. Green will tell her to talk later at the rave.
- **CHI Office:** Marina goes to the CHI office on the base and meets Yasmin. She quietly grills her about the crash, her life on earth, and how compliant she will be on Mars. She completes a CHI onboarding screening and receives an upgraded proprietary TORUS device.
- **Medbay Sneak:** Marina heads to the medbay and sneaks Vasilii’s TORUS device out, syncing her disabled old TORUS to grab the audit log. She discovers that Vasilii was doing research about the Chinese presence on Mars when he discovered tracking software being activated on his device.
- **Rave:** Marina heads down to the GATE SPRING rave. She talks to Green about the bugged TORUS. He shares a rumor that the Chinese sent a distress signal to a NATO-operated waypoint station during their construction process that the US refused to comply with, causing a diplomatic incident and possibly contributing to the tragedy on Mars.
- **Conspiracy:** Svetlana notes it would be convenient for CHI and the G7 nations to let the Chinese base collapse so they could secure a foothold on Mars the same way they control the Moon.
- **Dance Sequence:** Marina can dance in a rhythm mini-game and take MDMA at the end of the rave, floating in the air when they temporarily disable the artificial gravity. She has another, more gentle dream sequence.
- **End of Act 2**

**Act 3**
- **Alarm:** Alarm klaxons fire in the early morning. Someone has broken security protocols and stolen an EVA suit. Dr. Malcolm confirms that Vasilii has escaped the medbay and gives Marina access to the doors to help the search teams find him.
- **Search:** Marina can use TORUS to search for Vasilii via a heartbeat sensor or pathfind through destroyed areas of the base to find the Computer Lab.
- **Confrontation:** Vasilii has blown the pressure windows to the lab, exposing the room to the vacuum of space. He has locked himself inside and is taking a fire ax to the servers, saying he will kill everyone on the base the same way Russia and the G7 killed 850 Chinese people 20 years ago.
- **Decision:** If he continues to do damage to the room, the life support systems on the base will fail. He has locked out the command staff and the security team.
- **Resolution:** Marina gets into an EVA suit and can either physically overpower Vasilii or talk him down before he destroys the core systems. With Marina’s success, the security team takes Vasilii into custody.
- **Confrontation:** Marina confronts Pike and Collins about the Mars rumor. They both admit that it is possible the story is true. The Cold War between the G7 and China was much hotter 20 years ago and it wouldn’t be unthinkable. Pike observes that regardless of the circumstance, something went wrong on Mars before the distress call went out to the NATO platform. Denying help to the Chinese doesn’t explain why they were asking for help in the first place. The files on the incident have been suppressed by both governments.
- **Resolution:** They resolve to discontinue getting updates for their TORUS network until they independently verify any packages they receive from Earth. Collins vows that the moonbase will take care of their own, first.
- **Final Encouragement:** Svetlana encourages Marina to go on the ARES mission and carry on Vasilii’s dream of a united space.
- **End**
