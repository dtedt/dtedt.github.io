**The Security Department** exists to deter disobedience or unanticipated violence on-base. Led by Chief Masaki, Security personnel are authorized to use physical force if necessary in their role as disciplinarians and conflict mediators. [Marina](Marina.md) is liable to be arrested and relocated to the holds if caught engaging in disorderly conduct. Security also has access to a database of criminal records not available to the other departments.

On Day 1, Chief Masaki exhibits signs of mutism and ultimately dons the mask on Day 2, becoming [an Other](LogosPathogenesis.md). This creates a crisis of leadership within Security. Officer Kent ultimately assumes control and implements a zero tolerance policy for [mask-wearing](Domino.md), resulting in the arrest and confinement of countless masked Others on Level01.
